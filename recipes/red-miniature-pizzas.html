    <h3>Step by step instruction</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To prepare red miniature pizzas, first place the flour in a bowl together with the crumbled fresh brewer's yeast. 
            Add water at room temperature and stir with a wooden spoon.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add sugar, salt and pour in oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix the ingredients thoroughly, then transfer to a work surface and knead vigorously until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Form a ball with the kneaded dough, oil a large bowl and place the dough in it, 
            cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for about 3 hours at room temperature, 
            away from drafts or in an oven with the light on. Once the dough has risen, it will have tripled in volume.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the meantime, prepare the pizza topping: in a bowl pour the tomato, season with salt, pepper, oregano and oil. 
            Mix everything with a spoon and set aside until you need to use it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the leavened dough onto a pastry board and sprinkle with very little flour; 
            roll out with a rolling pin until you obtain a rectangle about 1/4-inch (4 mm) thick.
        </li>
        <li>
            Oil thoroughly the drip pan where you will cook miniature pizzas. Cut the dough with a 3-inch (7.5 cm) diameter round pastry cutter. 
            Take the excess dough, give it a round shape and let it rest covered for about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can knead any excess dough and make more pizzas: you will get a total of 24 miniature pizzas! 
            Take them one by one with a spatula and start placing them on the baking tray.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the miniature pizzas are on the tray, apply some pressure in the center, leaving a 1/4-inch (0.5 cm) edge.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut mozzarella cheese into cubes and season the center with tomato and mozzarella cubes, drizzle with oil and a pinch of oregano to taste. 
            Bake the miniature pizzas in a static oven preheated to 400°F (200°C): the first 10 minutes with the tray on the lower shelf; 
            the remaining 5 minutes on the top shelf. Once cooked, take out the red miniature pizzas and serve them hot!
