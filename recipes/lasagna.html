    <h2>How to make lasagne</h2>
    <h3>Presentation</h3>
    <p>The lasagna recipe is a great classic of Italian cuisine, 
        more precisely from Emilia.
        It is a very tasty first course that best expresses 
        all the opulence of the Bolognese culinary tradition. 
        Several layers of egg pasta with spinach are in fact enriched with 
        a creamy filling based on bechamel, 
        meat sauce and grated Parmesan cheese.

    <h3>Step by step instruction</h3>
    <div class="step">
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil and butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over the heat, 
                add the chopped onion and brown it gently, 
                then add the chopped celery and carrot and brown these too. 
                Add the bacon and, after a minute, 
                the minced meat. Brown over high heat, 
                stirring constantly and shelling with a spoon. 
                When it changes color, add coarse salt and freshly whipped pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Deglaze with the white wine, which you will allow to evaporate. 
                Add the tomato puree and the two tablespoons of concentrate. 
                Stir and bring to a boil, then cover and cook for about two hours over very low heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the meantime, transfer the spinach to a saucepan with a finger of water, add salt and cook, 
                lightly covered, until tender. Drain them, stop cooking under running cold water and squeeze them very well, 
                so that they do not release any residual water. Put them in the mixer jar and chop finely. 
                Prepare the pastry: mix the ingredients by hand or with the planetary mixer until you obtain a homogeneous, 
                smooth and elastic dough, which you will put inside a well-closed plastic food bag. 
                Let it rest for at least 1 hour at room temperature.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll out the dough with a rolling pin on the floured pastry board, 
                bringing it to a thickness that is not too thin and, with a sharp kitchen knife or a pastry wheel, 
                cut into rectangles which must be slightly smaller than the pan. 
                Place a large saucepan full of water on the stove and bring it to a boil. 
                Salt it and add a little oil. Then boil a rectangle of pasta at a time, turning it, when it rises to the surface, 
                transfer it, with the help of a skimmer, into the bowl with cold water, drain it and pat it well with a cloth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place a first rectangle inside the pan to cover the bottom. Make a layer of béchamel, 
                taking care to reach the edges well and cover with ragù.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle with plenty of grated Parmesan cheese. Cover with another rectangle of pasta and proceed in this way until all the ingredients are used up. 
                You will have to do 5-6 layers in all. Finish by covering everything with a last rectangle of dough, which will roast during cooking becoming crunchy
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 180 °, fan mode. Before baking, portion the lasagna with a knife. Cook them for about 45 minutes, 
                or in any case until they have swollen and are hot inside as well. Check them frequently and, if they take too much color, cover them with aluminum foil. 
                Remove the covering layer of pasta and brown for a few minutes under the grill. 
                Remove from the oven, settle for 5 minutes and immediately serve your Bolognese lasagna.
